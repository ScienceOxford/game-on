  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Game On!' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will create a game using MakeCode Arcade.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Feb21CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#working-game">click here</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="starter" class="left">
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://arcade.makecode.org/" target="_blank">the MakeCode Arcade editor</a>, and click <strong>New Project</strong>.</p>
    <p>You should see a screen like the picture below, with the <em>emulator</em> on the left, the <em>menu</em> in the middle, and your <em>code</em> on the right.</p>
    <img src=".\images\1-emulator.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the editor - emulator on the left, the menu in the middle, your code on the right" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>You create your program by dragging-and-dropping blocks from the menu onto the coding area, and slotting them together - similar to Scratch.<p>
    <p>For the rest of these instructions, we will walk through creating the pancake collecting game shown above.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="first-sprite" class="left">
    <h3>Adding a background & your first sprite</h3>
    <p>Click on the <strong>Scene</strong> menu to find blocks related to the background of your game.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>set background image to []</strong> block, and drag it into your <strong>on start</strong> block.</p>
    <img src=".\images\2-background.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Click on the grey box in this block to design your background, or choose from the gallery.</p>
    <br>Click on the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu to find blocks to create and edit sprites - anything that moves, or interacts with other things in your game is a sprite.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>set mySprite to sprite [] of kind Player</strong> block, and drag it into your <strong>on start</strong> block, underneath the background block.</p>
    <img src=".\images\3-add-sprite.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image, set mySprite to sprite of kind Player" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Click on the grey box in this block to design your sprite, then <strong>rename it</strong> by clicking on the red <strong>mySprite</strong> box - what is your character called?</p>
    <img src=".\images\4-rename-variable.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image, set mySprite to sprite of kind Player" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>You should now see on your emulator your background, and your chosen sprite in the middle of the screen.</p>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Now is a good time to save your game so you don't lose it!</strong></p>
    <p>To start the game with your sprite in a different place, open the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu again, and find the <strong>set mySprite position to x 0 y 0</strong> block.</p>
    <p>Place this block underneath your current code, still inside the <strong>on start</strong> loop.</p>
    <p>Because we renamed our sprite, change <strong>mySprite</strong> to the name of your sprite (later in the game you will have multiple sprites to choose from!).</p>
    <p>Your sprite has now moved up to the top left corner of the emulator! This is because the position is set to <strong>x=0, y=0</strong>, which are the coordinates of the top left.</p>
    <p>Change the position by choosing new coordinates, by clicking on the x or y option on the block - choose the best place for your sprite to start the game!</p>
    <img src=".\images\5-set-position.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - set mySprite to sprite of kind Player, set mySprite position to x 0 y 0" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Remember to save your game!</strong></p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="moving" class="left">
    <h3>Controlling your sprite's movements</h3>
    <p>Click on the <strong>Controller</strong> menu to find blocks related to movement.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>move mySprite with buttons</strong> block, and add it to your code.</p>
    <p>Remember to choose your sprite's name, so the game knows which one to move!</p>
    <p>Try controlling your sprite using the joystick on the emulator. You can also control it using either the arrow keys or WASD on your keyboard.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You probably noticed that your sprite can disappear off the side of the screen!</p>
    <p>Look in the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu for the <strong>set mySprite stay in screen</strong> block and add it to your code. Update the name, and turn it on!</p>
    <img src=".\images\6-move-sprite.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - move mySprite with buttons, set mySprite stay in screen ON" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Remember to save your game!</strong></p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="second-sprite" class="left">
    <h3>Adding a second sprite & interacting with it</h3>
    <p>We currently have a cool background, and our scientist character who we can move around the screen. Next, we add her pancake making machine!</p>
    <p>The same as you did for your first sprite, use the <strong>set mySprite to sprite [] of kind Player</strong> block, to create the pancake machine.</p>
    <p>Rename it to something else, such as <em>Machine</em>, and design your sprite or choose one from the gallery.</p>
    <p>The last part of that block says that the sprite is a <strong>Player</strong> - this isn't true for the machine!</p>
    <p>Click the box to see the list of options, then choose <em>Add a new kind</em> as none of the options fit! For example, say that it is a <strong>Device</strong> or <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
    <img src=".\images\7-second-sprite.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - set mySprite2 to sprite of kind Player - showing options to change Player to Projectile, Food, Enemy or Add a new kind" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Where do you want the machine to be at the start of your game? Find the <strong>set mySprite position to x 0 y 0</strong>, remembering to choose the correct sprite, and position it in a good location.</p>
    <img src=".\images\8-position-second-sprite.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - set mySprite2 to sprite of kind Device, set mySprite2 position to x 138 y 101" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Your code so far should look something like the picture below - you have create two sprites and set them up for the start of the game.</p>
    <img src=".\images\9-steps-so-far.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks showing all the code so far, plus the emulator showing the position of the sprites" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Now is a good time to save your game so you don't lose it!</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>We are going to start a new <em>loop</em> now - a block of code that other things can slot inside - to decide what happens when the two sprites <strong>overlap</strong>.</p>
    <p>Open the <strong>Sprites</strong> menu, and scroll down until you find the <strong>on sprite of kind Player overlaps with otherSprite of kind Player</strong> block, and add it to your main coding window.</p>
    <p>We don't care what happens when a Player overlaps with a Player, because we only have one Player! So change the second option to <strong>Device</strong> (or whatever you classified your machine as).</p>
    <p>Also in the <strong>Sprite menu</strong>, find the <strong>mySprite</strong> start spray effect</strong> block as slot it into the <strong>overlap</strong> block you just created.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>The next step is very important!</strong></p>
    <p>The overlap block works by saying what happens when any <strong>Player</strong> overlaps with any <strong>Device</strong>, so if we name which sprite starts the effect, our code will not work as expected later on in the game, when we have more sprites.</p>
    <p>To make sure that the effect happens to the specific <strong>Device</strong> that the <strong>Player</strong> overlaps (touches), drag the red <strong>otherSprite</strong> oval from the overlap block, and drop it into the effect block, on top of the mySprite option. See the picture below.</p>
    <img src=".\images\10-overlap.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on sprite of kind Player overlaps otherSprite of kind Device, otherSprite start spray effect" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Make sure that this works by moving your character onto the machine, the machine should start a spray effect!</p>
    <p>At the moment, the spray effect will not stop... click the <em>plus button</em> on the effect block to set how long the effect continues for.</p>
    <p>Which effect do you want to use? The code below shows the <em>hearts</em> effect running for <em>500ms</em>.</p>
    <img src=".\images\11-hearts-for-time.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on sprite of kind Player overlaps otherSprite of kind Device, otherSprite start hearts effect for 500ms" width="600px" height="auto">

  </div>

  <div id="projectile" class="left">
    <h3>Adding a projectile</h3>
    <p>Time to add the pancakes!</p>
    <p>We want to machine to fling pancakes on a regular basis. Open the <strong>Game</strong> menu and pull out the <strong>on game update every 500ms</strong> loop - you can change the number of miliseconds to make the pancakes appear more or less often.
    <p>Moving sprites are <strong>projectiles</strong>, and you can find the block you need in the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu - <strong>set projectile to projectile [] from mySprite with vx 50 vy 50</strong>.</p>
    <img src=".\images\13-add-projectile.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on game update every 500ms, set projectile to projectile from mySprite with vx 50 vy 50" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>There is a lot happening in this block, so lets take things one step at a time.</p>
    <p>Rename the projectile to <strong>Pancake</strong>, so you know what is being created.</p>
    <p>Click in the grey box to design your pancake - how big or small you make the picture will determine how easy they are to collect!</p>
    <p>Change <strong>from mySprite</strong> to <strong>from Machine</strong> - this chooses where the pancakes start.</p>
    <p>vx and vy are the <strong>velocity - speed in a direction</strong>. vx shows how fast it moves left/right across the screen, and vy show fast up/down. If you keep the numbers equal, it will move diagonally!</p>
    <p>Before changing the velocity, look at how the pancakes are moving - which direction do they go?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What happens when you make the number bigger or smaller?</li>
      <li>How do you think you could make it travel the other direction?</li>
    </ul>
    <img src=".\images\14-renamed-projectile.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on game update every 1000ms, set Pancake to projectile from Machine with vx -50 vy -50" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Now is a good time to save your game so you don't lose it!</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>It's not much of a game if you know where the projectiles are going to move every time, so let's make it random!</p>
    <p>Look in the <strong>Math</strong> menu for the <strong>pick random from 0 to 10</strong> block, and drop it into the number slot of vx. What do you need your minimum and maximum to be, based on how the pancakes moved in your experiments?</p>
    <p>Repeat the above step for vy, and check that everything works.</p>
    <img src=".\images\15-random-velocity.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on game update every 1000ms, set Pancake to projectile from Machine with vx pick random -50 to 0 vy pick random -50 to 0" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Finally, think about what you want your game to be, and decide whether pancakes are <strong>Food</strong>, <strong>Enemy</strong> or something else.</p>
    <p>Find the <strong>set mySprite kind to Player</strong> block in the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu, and reclassify your pancakes to make it easier to use them in your game later.</p>
    <img src=".\images\16-code-so-far.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on game update every 1000ms, set Pancake to projectile from Machine with vx pick random -50 to 0 vy pick random -50 to 0, set Pancake kind to Food" width="1000px" height="auto">

  </div>

  <div id="scoring" class="left">
    <h3>Adding scoring</h3>
    <p>Final step in making a working game, is catching the pancakes and adding up the score.</p>
    <p>We want another <strong>overlap</strong> block for this - this time checking when the <strong>Player</strong> overlaps with <strong>Food</strong> or <strong>Enemy</strong>, or whatever you classified your pancakes as.</p>
    <p>Into this loop drop a <strong>destroy mySprite</strong> block from the <strong>Sprites</strong> menu, and remember to update it to destroy <strong>otherSprite</strong>, so that the specific pancake you get to is the one that is destroyed.</p>
    <img src=".\images\17-overlap-food.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on sprite of kind Player overlaps otherSprite of kind Food, destroy otherSprite" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Click the <em>plus button</em> to add an effect that happens when the sprite is destroyed, and for how long.</p>
    <p>Finally, the score! Look in the <strong>Info</strong> menu for <strong>change score by 1</strong>.</p>
    <img src=".\images\18-code-so-far.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on sprite of kind Player overlaps otherSprite of kind Food, destroy otherSprite with smiles effect for 200ms, change score by 1" width="1000px" height="auto">

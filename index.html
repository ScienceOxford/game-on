  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Game On!' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will create a game using MakeCode Arcade.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Feb21CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#working-game">click here</a>.</p>

  <div id="starter" class="left">
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://arcade.makecode.org/" target="_blank">the MakeCode Arcade editor</a>, and click <strong>New Project</strong>.</p>
    <p>You should see a screen like the picture below, with the <em>emulator</em> on the left, the <em>menu</em> in the middle, and your <em>code</em> on the right.</p>
    <img src=".\images\1-emulator.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the editor - emulator on the left, the menu in the middle, your code on the right" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>You create your program by dragging-and-dropping blocks from the menu onto the coding area, and slotting them together - similar to Scratch.<p>
    <p>For the rest of these instructions, we will walk through creating the pancake collecting game shown above.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="first-sprite" class="left">
    <h3>Adding a background & your first sprite</h3>
    <p>Click on the <strong>Scene</strong> menu to find blocks related to the background of your game.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>set background image to []</strong> block, and drag it into your <strong>on start</strong> block.</p>
    <img src=".\images\2-background.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Click on the grey box in this block to design your background, or choose from the gallery.</p>
    <br>Click on the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu to find blocks to create and edit sprites - anything that moves, or interacts with other things in your game is a sprite.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>set mySprite to sprite [] of kind Player</strong> block, and drag it into your <strong>on start</strong> block, underneath the background block.</p>
    <img src=".\images\3-add-sprite.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image, set mySprite to sprite of kind Player" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Click on the grey box in this block to design your sprite, then <strong>rename it</strong> by clicking on the red <strong>mySprite</strong> box - what is your character called?</p>
    <img src=".\images\4-rename-variable.PNG" alt="Screenshot of blocks - on start, set background image, set mySprite to sprite of kind Player" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>You should now see on your emulator your background, and your chosen sprite in the middle of the screen.</p>
    <p class=debugging><strong>Now is a good time to save your game so you don't lose it!</strong></p>
    <p>To start the game with your sprite in a different place, open the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu again, and find the <strong>set mySprite position to x 0 y 0</strong> block.</p>
    <p>Place this block underneath your current code, still inside the <strong>on start</strong> loop.</p>
    <p>Because we renamed our sprite, change <strong>mySprite</strong> to the name of your sprite (later in the game you will have multiple sprites to choose from!).</p>
    <p>Your sprite has now moved up to the top left corner of the emulator! This is because the position is set to <strong>x=0, y=0</strong>, which are the coordinates of the top left.</p>
    <p>Change the position by choosing new coordinates, by clicking on the x or y option on the block - choose the best place for your sprite to start the game!</p>

    <h3>The game so far!</h3>
    <p>You can download a working copy of the game so far, to explore and edit, by <a href=".examples\Scientist-Pancake-Game.png" target="_blank">saving this file</a>.</p>
    <p>To open it, drag-and-drop it into the MakeCode Arcade editor.</p>
    <p>Use the steps above to help you edit the game to make it your own - change the background and sprites, and try changing the speed and direction of the pancakes as well!</p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>Get creative and add different features to your game - what theme do you want to use?</p>
    <p>The links below will help you with a couple of our ideas!</p>

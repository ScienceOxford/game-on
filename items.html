    <h1>Collecting Items</h1>
  </header>

  <div id="set-up" class="left">
    <p>In this example, we will add an item to the game that your player can collect. A future tutorial page will expand on this so that the item either gives the character another life, or makes them invulnerable for a certain length of time.</p>
    <p>Step 1 is to create a new sprite for the item - but we don't want it to appear at the start of the game, we want it to be created at a random time and in a random position!</p>
    <p>To do this, use an <strong>on game update every 500ms</strong> block, and combine this with a <strong>pick random</strong> block from the <strong>Math</strong> menu, to allow your item to be created at random times!</p>

    <p>Try out this code and see what happens.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How often does an item get created?</li>
      <li>Where on the screen is it?</li>
      <li>Do they ever disappear?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next steps for this project are...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When your character overlaps with the item, destroy it.</li>
      <li>When your character overlaps with the item, how can you show that they picked it up? Try changing the appearence of the sprite!</li>
      <li>Do you want more than one item to be created at once, or should the old one get destroyed when a new one is created?</li>
      <li>What effect do you want the item to have on the character? Addings lives (using the Info menu), or adding invulnerability (you will need an 'if then else' statement!).</li>
    </ol>

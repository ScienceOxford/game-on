    <h1>Shoot Down the Pancakes</h1>
  </header>

  <div id="set-up" class="left">
    <p>You can expand the game by getting your player to shoot the pancakes, instead of (or as well as!) collecting them personally.</p>
    <p>The emulator has two buttons we haven't used yes, <strong>A and B</strong>.</p>
    <p>Find the <strong>on A button pressed</strong> block from the <strong>Controller</strong> menu, and create a new projectile from the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu.</p>
    <p>Name your new projectile sprite and design it (I chose arrows!), and tell them to be created <strong>from your player sprite</strong>.</p>
    <p>Adjust the velocity until you are happy with the direction your new projectiles go.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Adjust your <strong>overlap</strong> block, so instead of scoring when your player overlaps with your Food/Enemy/pancakes, you score when your <strong>Projectile</strong> overlaps instead.</p>

    <p>Test it out to make sure it works, then decide what you want to do next...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you make the arrow disappear when it hits a pancake?</li>
      <li>Can you create a second projectile, maybe one fast and one slow?</li>
      <li>Could you assign different points for hitting the pancake with a projectile vs with the player?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Make an Enemy Follow your Player</h1>
  </header>

  <div id="set-up" class="left">
    <p>One way to make your game exciting, could be to make an enemy or obstacle follow your player around, so you have to keep moving to stay out of their way!</p>
    <p>For example, to make the pancake machine follow our player, we need to find its set-up instructions in the <strong>on start</strong> loop, and add a follow block.</p>
    <p>From the <strong>Sprite</strong> menu, find the <strong>set myEnemy follow myPlayer</strong> block, and add it underneath your sprite set-up code - remember to choose the correct sprites - who should follow who?</p>

    <br>
    <p>Test out your game - the following sprite probably catches up with your player pretty quickly!</p>
    <p>You can change the speed of your player, or your enemy, or both, by expanding their movement blocks.</p>
    <p>Click the <em>plus button</em> at the end of the follow block (or at the end of your move player with buttons block) and change the speed.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Make sure to make something happen when your player gets caught by adding or editing your <strong>overlap</strong> blocks!</p>
